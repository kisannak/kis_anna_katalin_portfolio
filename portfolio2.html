		<div class="bemutatkozas"><span class="eleje"><b>I’m Anna Katalin Kis</b>, and I was born in 2001 in Budapest, Hungary. I have loved drawing since I was a little girl and I’m also into activities which involve any kind of creative thinking. My hometown is Szentendre, a small town within the Budapest Metropolitan Area, but fortunately, it is far enough to be a silent, friendly and inspiring town, which, for these reasons, is also called „the town of artists”.</span> <span> <br>Living in a large family, in a place surrounded by forests and a stream, with fields packed with their natural wildlife, and by living a socially active lifestyle, I can call myself a truly lucky person who is constantly having the chance to observe the various patterns, shapes and colours of nature or society and the difference between the people’s reaction, behaviour or emotion induced by them.</span><br><span>
The moment I  became mature enough to understand the saying “don’t judge by appearance” was when I realized how powerful impact design has in our age and society.  I said to myself that it’s definitely worth the time, attention and effort. I suddenly had the feeling that it could be my way to succeed, not to mention that ’ technology these days helps almost every specific thought to become reality. 
As for education, I’m studying Industrial Design Engineering at Budapest University of Technology and Economics. I think this is the first milestone of my journey.</span> <br><span>After BSc, I’m planning to continue my  studies abroad, to expand my horizons culturally. I’m eager to acquire how people in other countries see the world, how they live, what sort of things they like and so on. My point is that it is important to have an international perspective
As the time goes by, I continuously develop new skills and methods helping me on my way in the field of design to succeed.</span>
